# `PIXELBOARD`

The `pixelboard` project combines an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi and a WS2812b LED board to make a retro styled pixel board, creating a gaming console, table or monitor. 

The Arduino runs the game code, meaning low intensity games can be played using a simple power bank. The Pi hosts a webapplication that can control which mode to set the pixel board in, and to remotely update the code running on the Arduino.

At the time of writing, the project is in its very early stages and has a running prototype of Pong, but no working webapp. More to come, hopefully.
